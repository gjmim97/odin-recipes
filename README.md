# recipe_site
This website was made to demonstrate the content I have learned from the Foundations Course in The Odin Project. 

This website will showcase knowledge of the Terminal, Git, GitHub and HTML only. 

The scope of HTML knowledge extends to:
- Creating the basic structure of a website (the 'Boilerplate' HTML)
- Links (to images and other webpages via absolute and relative links)
- Lists (unordered and ordered)
