        <h1>Tagliatelle Ragu Romagnolo with Parmesan Cream</h1>
            <p>The following is a recipe from Pentolinas, Melbourne. This dish applies a modern twist to traditional Italian flavours. For me, the highlight of this dish is the balance between the savoury ragu romagnolo sauce and the tangy cheese sauce, which has been separated.</p>
            <p>Cook Time: 3 hours</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Ragu Romagnolo Sauce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use a sharp paring knife to finely and evenly chop the carrot, onion, and garlic cloves.</li>
                    <li>In a saucepan, add two tablespoons of oil, and sauté the vegetables until softened (about 5 -7 minutes);</li>
                    <li>Add the ground meat, the sausage, and the bacon; fry them over medium high heat until golden brown for about 5 minutes; </li>
                    <li>Add salt and pepper, some grated nutmeg, and the parsley; stir well;</li>
                    <li>Pour in the red wine and sauté over medium high heat until it has completely evaporated; </li>
                    <li>Add the tomato sauce, the tomato paste, a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar;</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir occasionally for 1 hour;</li>
                    <li>Partially cover the saucepan and cook for another 2 hours; stir and check the ragù every now and then. If it gets too thick, add a little hot water; </li>
                    <li>Pour the ragù into glass containers and store in the fridge or freeze for later use.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Parmigiano Reggiano Cream</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>To make Parmigiano Reggiano cream, first heat the milk and cream in a saucepan. Add the grated parmigiano 1 tablespoon at a time, continuing to stir with a whisk.   Continue stirring over a low flame until all the cheese is used.</li>
                    <li>In the end, the consistency should be similar to a custard. Complete with a pinch of salt and nutmeg.</li>
                    <li>An alternative: If you want to use the cream to season tortellini, which are cooked in broth, just replace the milk with the same amount of broth. It should be enough for 4-6 people.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Assembly</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil the tagliatelle pasta for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>On a plate, pour some of the parmigiano reggiano cream to form the base.</li>
                    <li>Add the cooked tagliatelle pasta on top of the parmiagiano cream and pour the ragu romagnolo on top before serving.</li>
                </ol>
