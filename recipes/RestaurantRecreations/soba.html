        <h1>Cold Soba and Tempura Prawn</h1>
            <a href="../../index.html">Home</a>
            <p>The cold soba and tempura prawn from Honke Owaria was the best dish I ate when I travelled to Japan. Although this recipe will not be as good as going to the restaurant, it is good enough to appease your soba cravings.</p>
            <p><strong>Cook Time: </strong>40 minutes</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Place soba noodle in a shallow container and add enough water (not listed in ingredients) to just cover the noodles for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the noodle is being soaked in water, start to boil 12 cups of water in a large pot over high heat.</li>
                    <li>Also make the dipping sauce at this point following the instructions below.</li>
                    <li>Add the vegetable oil into the pot.</li>
                    <li>Remove the noodles from the soaking water and put them into the boiling water in the large pot.</li>
                    <li>Cook the noodles for 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Turn the heat off and drain the cooking water.</li>
                    <li>Wash the cooked noodle under running water.</li>
                    <li>Drain the water, remove excess water and serve the soba noodle on a bamboo strainer.</li>
                    <li>Top with shredded nori seaweed and serve with a cup of mentsuyu dipping sauce and your choice of condiments.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Tempura Prawn</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the prawn and vegetables and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Place the flour and add icey cold water and mayonnaise. Combine them together briefly (don't over-mix or it will be too gooey).</li>
                    <li>Set aside in fridge until all ingredients and oil is ready.</li>
                    <li>Fill a deep pan or deep-fryer with vegetable oil and heat until 180c.</li>
                    <li>Add each ingredient (prawn & vegetable) to the batter individually to coat them and put them into the oil.</li>
                    <li>When the prawn and vegetable is cooked, if you lift them up out of cooking oil with a pair of chopsticks you can feel tiny vibration.</li>
                    <li>When the ingredients are cooked, place them onto a plate lined with a paper towel to absorb the excess oil.</li>
                    <li>Continue to coat and fry each ingredient until all done.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Assembly</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare grated raddish, wasabi and chopped green onions in a separate bowl</li>
                    <li>Mix condiments into the mentsuyu per your personal preference</li>
                    <li>Dip the tempura into the sauce and enjoy with the cold soba</li>
                </ol>
