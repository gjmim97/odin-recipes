        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Carne Asada Prep</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk ¼ cup water, the onion, cilantro, oil, lemon juice, salt, garlic salt, black pepper and cayenne together in a large nonreactive bowl. Put the steak in a 1 gallon zipped plastic bag, and add the marinade. Close the bag and refrigerate, turning the bag occasionally, for at least 12 and up to 24 hours.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Tortillas</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine the flour, shortening, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. Stir in the water. Knead the mixture in the bowl until it forms a smooth dough, about 1 minute. Shape it into a ball. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough stand for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces, and shape each into a ball. One at a time, on a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough balls into 6 inch rounds. Stack the tortillas, separated by sheets of wax paper.</li>
                    <li>Heat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add the tortillas in a single layer and cook until the undersides have golden-brown splotches, about 1 ½ minutes. Turn and cook until the other sides look the same, about 1 ½ minutes more. Stack the cooked tortillas on a baking sheet.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Salsa Ranchera</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pulse the onion, cilantro, chiles de arbol, jalapeño and garlic in a food processor until combined and chopped a bit more finely. Add the tomatoes and pulse to make a coarse salsa. Season with salt. Transfer the salsa to a serving bowl. Let it stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 8 hours.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Avocado Sauce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Puree the avocados in a food processor, adding enough milk to give the sauce the consistency of yogurt. Season with salt. Transfer it to a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Carne Asada Cooking</h3>   
                <ol>
                    <li>Remove the steaks from the marinade and shake off the excess marinade. Lightly brush the steaks with oil. Let them stand for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>To make the steaks indoors: position the broiler rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler on high. Place the oiled steaks on the broiler rack and grill, turning once, until they are browned and medium rare, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
                    <li>To make steaks outdoors: For a gas grill, preheat it to at least 500 degrees F. Place a disposable foil smoker pan directly on the heat source. For a charcoal grill, let the coals burn until they are covered with white ash and you can hold your hands above the cooking grate for only 1 or 2 seconds. Place the steaks on the grill. Cook, with the lid closed as much as possible, until the undersides are well browned, about 2 ½ minutes. Turn the steaks over and grill until the other sides are browned and the meat is medium rare, about 2 ½ minutes more. Transfer steaks to a carving board and let them stand for 5 minutes before carving.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Assembly</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Warm tortillas in a skillet or on the grill, about 1 minute per side. Transfer them to a towel-lined basket or bowl and cover to keep warm. Cut the steaks across the grain into thin strips and transfer them, with any juices, to a serving bowl. Serve the tortillas, steak strips, and scallions with bowls of the salsa, avocado sauce, onion, cilantro, lime and cucumber. Let each guest build a taco, filling a tortilla with the desired ingredients and folding it in half before eating.</li>
